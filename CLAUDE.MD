We are going to add the names of samples, which are located at "C:\Users\Liam\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Samples\pokemoncries".
You will first need to write a script that scans this directory and lists all the sample names that end in .mp3 and not .asd in a text file called "pokemon_cries_list.txt". 
The text file should be created in the current directory. 
use node on the command line to run the script.
